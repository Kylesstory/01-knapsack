# 01-Knapsack

A dynamic solution of the 01-knapsack problem.

Two solutions are provided in this work, **Knapsack algorithm** and **Brute Force**.
The former one is applied in a complex case with higher capacity or number of items; and the latter one is adopted in easy cases.

## Input file format

The default file path is the same as the program itself, "*./your-input-file.txt*"; or you can modify the path to indicate your target file.

 - Lines begin with symbol # will not be read as records. 
 - The first  un-noted and non-empty line stands for capacity. 
 - Others are in form of [weight], [value].

The format could be found in file "*./your-input-file.txt*"; or you might follow the sample below:

#This is note.
[capacity]
[weight1], [value1]
[weight2], [value2]
[weight3], [value3]
